# Uptime Monitor

Hi! Welcome to my Uptime Monitor Frontend project page. I made a NodeJS Uptime monitor to monitor servers in a cool looking way. This is only the front-end of the project in plain HTML.

## Description

Uptime monitor is made in NodeJS, with as little Dependencies as needed. Its working with MySQL and JSON. With MySQL we post and get status of the servers.    
I made a seperate page of the frontend for people who like the design. The front-end is complete with Bootstrap and FontAwesome!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* A working webserver i guess?

### Installing

It works out of the box since its HTML :P

### Executing program

* Start your webserver

## Help
